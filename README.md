## ‚ú® What does Brian RSS do?

- Keeps a list of books you want to learn more about
- Extract a new random topic from each book
- Generate a summary of that topic using AI
- Create audio summaries in a podcast-like format
- Deliver these content daily through RSS feeds

Brian RSS leverages OpenAI's model knowledge about books, so you don't need to upload any book content or PDF to generate summaries.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

- Ruby & Sinatra
- Docker
- OpenAI API
- Cron scheduling

The models used are:

- **gpt-4o** for text generation
- **tts-1** for text-to-speech audio generation

No database is required, as all data is stored in a simple JSON file.

## üí≤ Cost

Brian RSS is free to use, but you will need an OpenAI API key for the AI features. The cost will depend on your usage of the OpenAI API.
From my personal experience, while using the cheapest **tts-1** text-to-speech model, **the cost is approximately $0.05 per post generated, including text + audio.**

## üìã Prerequisites

- OpenAI API key (get one at https://platform.openai.com)
